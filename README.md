# twitchTV-feed
## a freecodecamp project

Objective: Build a page that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

User Story: 
- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv 
channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are 
streaming.

Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at 
http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.

Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: 
https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
