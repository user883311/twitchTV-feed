# TwitchTV Feed API

User Story: 
- I can see whether a list of Twitch channels are currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- I can click the status output, and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv 
channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are 
streaming.
